### Reflections 
- This project was my first time using universally unique identifier (UUID). Using a package to create unique IDs generated an ID of 36 characters (32 hexadecimal characters and 4 hyphens).
- This project was my first time deploying to Vercel. Installing the Vercel CLI was easy but when the CLI asked `Link to existing project?` I assumed it was 'y' since the project was already created on React and existed on GitHub but the correct answer was 'n'.
